Bamazon is a CLI node application.  The user will choose between 2 different files: bamazonCustomer or bamazonManager depending on whether they are a customer or an employee.  

If they would like to act as a customer, they will get started by typing 'node bamazonCustomer.js' in their terminal.  This will prompt them with a list of products for sale.

They choose the item number they would like to purchase, and the app will then prompt them to answer how many of that item they would like to purchase.  Once they enter a number the app will place the order and give them their total.
